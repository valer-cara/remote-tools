* Remote tools

** Open URL locally from remote emacs
   * SSH remote server configuration: add =StreamLocalBindUnlink yes= to =/etc/ssh/sshd_config=
   * Run =python ./local.py= on your laptop
   * When connecting to remote, make sure to forward a remote unix socket locally like =ssh you@remote -R /home/blk/remote.sock:/home/blk/local.sock=
   * Add this to the emacs config

*** StreamLocalBindUnlink option
    Unix sockets are fussy, they need to be =unlink()='ed after use. This option instructs the remote sshd to unlink =remote.sock= before trying to bind it again.
    Without this option, remote forwarding will fail because the remote sshd will get an "address in use" error when trying to do it's thing and establish forwarding on it's end.
